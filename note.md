#admin workflow
admin logs in
admin go to dashboard
in the dashboard, admin see:
    - students enrolled 
    - students for assessment 
    - students assessed 
    - students weekly progress report 
    - iep generation

    in the students enrolled:
        - admin see list of students that are assessed and enrolled
        - list of students can be filtered
        - search bar has filtered
        when admin click a student profile
            - admin can see student info
    in the students for assessment
        - admin see list of children ready to be assessed.
        for a child to be assessed, he or she needs to have:
            - specialist inpupt a
            - diagnostic report
            - parent input
        - admin generates report with a single click with the help of ai
        - admin can share file
    for the students assessed:
        - it's better to merge it with students for assessment
        - use a tag and filter to separate students to be assessed and students that are already assessed
        - students assessed are actually not yet students as they are still pending if they are to be enrolled or not
        - the decision solely lies with the parent
        - if after a week, no decision is made, or the parent decides not to enrolled her/his child to the school, then the child's assessment will be automatically deleted from the database
    in the students weekly progress report:
        - again, admin can see list of students 


what is a student info?
- contains basic info of the child.
- assessment, iep, and weekly progress reports. 
- as well as the dx report if avail
- basically everythin about the child.

what i think is better for the admin dashboard:
- when admin logs in, first thing he sees is a list of students
- a header with a menu (students, child assessment)
- but, i feel like when you first log in and what you see is a list of students, it's kind of overwhelming
- so the question i should ask is what is the most used feature?
- iep is once every school year
- assessment, is when a child needs to be assessed which is like at the start of the school year only
- weekly progress report is just like it's name says, weekly
- so if it's weekly progress report, is it beneficial to say that the first thing the admin sees when he logs in is a list of students?
- the thing is when you click a student, you see the students information. it does not matter where you click it from, whether it be in the students enrolled page or the weekly progress report.
